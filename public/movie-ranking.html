<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3> Baahubali 1</h3>

<p> I really liked the acting of the entire crew especially how the movie ended</p>

<h3> Baahubali 2</h3>

<p> I loved the sequences between kattappa and baahubali and the reason why kattappa killed baahubali</p>

<h3> RRR </h3>

<p> I liked the plot involving two different approaches to solve a similar problem</p>
